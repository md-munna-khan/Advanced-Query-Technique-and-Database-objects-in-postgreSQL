## Advanced Query Technique and Database objects in postgreSQL

## 10-2 Exploring Subqueries
- a sub query is a nested Query within another SQL statement
![alt text](image-1.png)
- this is single column

```sql
-- Retrieve all employees whose salary is greater than the highest salary of the HR department
--63000
-- ! SELECT * from employees WHERE  salary > 63000; -- wrong way

SELECT salary from employees WHERE department_name='HR';-- 63000

SELECT * from employees WHERE  salary > (SELECT max(salary) from employees WHERE department_name='HR');

-- Can return a single value
-- Can return multiple rows
-- Can return a single column


-- we used in
SELECT 
FROM
where
```
## 10-3 Utilizing Subqueries in Different Clauses

``` sql

-- Can return a single value
-- Can return multiple rows
-- Can return a single column


-- when we used select in sub Query and  we must be know select always return single values

SELECT *,(SELECT sum(salary) from employees) from employees


-- from use
SELECT department_name,sum(salary) from employees GROUP BY department_name;
SELECT * FROM -- main query 
(SELECT department_name,sum(salary) from employees GROUP BY department_name) as sum_dept; -- sub query


--- where 
SELECT * from employees WHERE  salary > (SELECT max(salary) from employees WHERE department_name='HR');

SELECT employee_name, salary, department_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_name in 
(SELECT department_name FROM employees WHERE department_name LIKE '%R%');
```
## 10-4 Exploring Views in PostgreSQL

- any complex query easily we called the create view and not need many time write same query just select view query name

=========== Benefit use view=======
-- Simplifying complex queries
-- Improved security
-- Enhanced data abstraction

```sql
CREATE View dept_avg_salary
AS
SELECT department_name,avg(salary) from employees  GROUP BY department_name;


SELECT department_name,avg(salary) from employees  GROUP BY department_name;

SELECT * from  dept_avg_salary ;

CREATE VIEW test_view
as
SELECT employee_name, salary, department_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_name in 
(SELECT department_name FROM employees WHERE department_name LIKE '%R%');

SELECT * from test_view;
```

## 10-5 Exploring Functions in PostgreSQL

```sql
/*
                    @Procedural Approach:
    1. Language Support: Supports procedural languages like PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, etc.
    2. Complex Logic: Allows for complex logic using control structures like loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
    3. Variable Support: Supports variable declarations and manipulation within the procedural code.
    4. Stored Procedures/Functions: Provides the ability to create stored procedures or functions, 

                    @Non-Procedural Approach:
    1. Declarative Queries: Focuses on writing declarative SQL queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data from the database.
    2. Simplicity: Emphasizes simplicity by expressing operations in terms of what data is needed.
    3. SQL Functions: Supports SQL functions, which are single SQL statements that return a value or set of values.
    4. Performance: Can sometimes offer better performance for simple operations due to the optimized query execution plans generated by the database engine.

SELECT count(*) FROM employees;

-- create function
CREATE or REPLACE Function emp_count()
RETURNS INT
LANGUAGE SQL
as 
$$
SELECT count(*) from employees

SELECT emp_count()

-- delete function
CREATE or REPLACE Function delete_emp()
RETURNS void --- because he is not return anything
LANGUAGE SQL
as
